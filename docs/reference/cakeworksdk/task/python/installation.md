# Task SDK Installation

Create your Cakework project using the CLI's [new](../../../cli/usage#cakework-new) command. Your new project will have the cakework module already installed.

Activate your Python virtual environment (venv) that the `cakework new` command had set up by going to your project directory and running:
```
source env/bin/activate
```
