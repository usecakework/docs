# Installation

The Cakework CLI is a command-line interface for using Cakework. You do just about everything in Cakework with ```cakeworkctl```, from creating your apps to pulling logs.

## macOS

To install the Cakework CLI, run the install script:

```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usecakework/cakeworkctl/main/install.sh | sh
```

After that, add the cakeworkctl directory to your shell rc file. Check the output of the install script for the exact command.
