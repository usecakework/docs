# Intro

Cakework helps you build async backends in minutes and operate them in production, without needing to manage any infrastructure. You write your backend as a Python app, and use the Cakework client to execute requests. Each request returns an id that you can use to track status and get processing results. Cakework is serverless and automatically scales to your production traffic.

Use Cakework for any async distributed task, such as file processing or customer journey automation. Our prototypical use case is speech analytics - taking an audio file, transcribing it, chunking it up, applying NLP on each chunk, joining it back up, and storing the result.

## Why Cakework?

We built Cakework to replace systems that are composed of multiple queues and workers. Cakework is a "batteries included" solution that includes features like APIs for task status or a CLI to rerun failed tasks. Cakework also solves a lot of pain points with serverless development, like local testing or managing cloud resources.
