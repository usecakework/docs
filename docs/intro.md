# Getting Started

Cakework helps you build, launch, and operate async backends in production, with zero infrastructure. Rather than setting up task queues, workers/lambdas, and databases or hosting Celery, you write your logic and run ```cakework start```. We take care of hosting, scaling, and provide features like status tracking and the ability to query for and rerun failed tasks. You can use Cakework for any longer running task that completes in the background, such as document processing using GPT-3.

:::caution
We are not in production yet, so all the usual "alpha software" warnings apply! Reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/yB6GvheDcP), [Github](https://github.com/usecakework), or [email](mailto:eric@cakework.com) if you have any issues. We'll help get you production-ready one way or another ðŸ˜Š.

## Install Cakework (macOS only)
Run the install script:

```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usecakework/cakeworkctl/main/install.sh | sh
```

After that, add the cakeworkctl directory to your shell rc file. Check the output of the install script for the exact command.
