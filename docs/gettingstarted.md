# Getting Started

:::caution
We are not in production yet, so all the usual "alpha software" warnings apply. Reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/yB6GvheDcP), [Github](https://github.com/usecakework), or [email](mailto:eric@cakework.com) for help!
:::

## Install the CLI
Run the following command. See [Reference](./reference/cli/installation.md) for more detail.

```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usecakework/cakework/main/cli/install.sh | sh
```

## Create an account
Sign up for a Cakework account.

```
cakework signup
```
If you're running from a machine where you cannot open a browser window (for example, if ssh'ed into an EC2 instance), run
```
cakework signup --headless
```

## Build Your Tasks

### Create a New Project
Create a new project with the Cakework CLI. We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management to make sure no dependencies get accidentally installed. 

```
cakework new yummy
cd yummy
```

### Write Your Task
You write tasks as Python functions and add the task to your project using the Task SDK. Using the client, you'll make requests with this function signature and get the return value as a result. The arguments and return value need to be JSON-serializable.

Here is sample code from your autogenerated ```src/main.py```. 

```python
# Write your task as a Python function
from cakework import Cakework

def say_hello(params):
    return "hello " + params['name']

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Instantiate your project with a name
    cakework = Cakework("hello_world")
    # Add your task to your project
    cakework.add_task(say_hello)
```

## Deploy Your Task
Deploy your task to Cakework, where your tasks will run serverlessly.
```
cakework deploy
```

## Run a Task
Once your task is deployed, you can run start making requests using the Cakework client.

### Generate Client Token
You need to generate a token to authenticate your client with your project. Keep your token safe.

```
cakework create-client-token my-client
```

### Use the Client
You run your task by instantiating a client. Running a task returns a run id that you can use to get the status or result of your task. The result of the task is the what your task function returned.

Here is sample code that shows how to instantiate a client and run a task.

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
from cakework import Client
import time

if __name__ == "__main__":

    # Instantiate a client with the project you created, and pass in your client token.
    client = Client("yummy", "CLIENT_TOKEN")

    # Start your task. 
    run_id = client.run("say_hello", {"name": "Jessie"}, "compute"={"cpu": 1, "memory": 512})

    # Poll the task until completion.
    status = client.get_run_status(run_id)
    while (status == "PENDING" or status == "IN_PROGRESS"):
        time.sleep(1)
        print(status)
        status = client.get_run_status(run_id)

    # Get the result once the task is complete!
    if (client.get_run_status(run_id) == "SUCCEEDED"):
        result = client.get_run_result(run_id)
        print(result)
```

### CPU / Memory
You can control your compute parameters per request with the `compute` argument to your function call. This is an optional parameter and defaults to a 1 CPU and 512MB of memory.

```python
# CPU can be between 1 and 8, and memory (MB) can be between 256 and 16384.
request_id = client.run_task('say_hello', {'name': 'Jessie'}, compute={'cpu': 1, 'memory': 1024})
```


## More!

### Installing Dependencies
We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. You can use Poetry commands as normal. Use ```poetry add``` to install a new dependency.

If you have a more complicated dependency situation, you can modify the generated Dockerfile.

### Python Version
By default, we create new Cakework projects in your system Python version. You can change this with Poetry using ```poetry env use``` but you also need to update the Dockerfile. Modify the ```FROM python:PYTHONVERSION-slim-buster``` line to the version of Python you're using.

### Error Handling
Any uncaught exceptions or errors in your task function will send your task to a ```FAILED``` status.

### Monitoring and Debugging
You can use the CLI to find tasks that failed, using ```cakework task logs --status FAILED <projectName> <taskName>```.

You can grab logs for any run using ```cakework run logs <run>```.

### Local Development
