# Getting Started

:::caution
We are not in production yet, so all the usual "alpha software" warnings apply. Reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/yB6GvheDcP), [Github](https://github.com/usecakework), or [email](mailto:eric@cakework.com) for help!
:::

## Install Cakework
Run the install script (macOS/Linux):

```
curl -L https://cakeworkctl-downloads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/install.sh | sh
```

After that, add the ```cakework``` directory to your shell rc file. Check the output of the install script for the exact command.

## Create an account

```
cakework signup
```

## Build Your App

### Create a New App
Create a new app with the Cakework CLI.

```
cakework new yummy-new-app --lang python
cd yummy-new-app
pip3 install cakework
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Write Your App
You can write tasks as Python functions and add the task to your app. Using the client, you'll start tasks with this function signature and get the return value as a result. The arguments and return value need to be JSON-serializable.

Here is sample code from your autogenerated ```src/main.py```. 

```python
# Write your task as a Python function.
def say_hello(name):
    return "hello " + name

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Instantiate your app client with the name of your app.
    app = App("hello_world")
    # Add your task to your app
    app.add_task(say_hello)
```

## Deploy Your App
Deploy your app to Cakework, where your tasks will run serverlessly.
```
cakework deploy
```

## Run a Task
Once your app is deployed, you can run start running tasks using the Cakework client.

### Generate Client Token
You need to generate a token to authenticate your client with your app. Keep your token safe.

```
cakework create-client-token my-client
```

### Use the Client
You run your task by instantiating a client and using the same function signature that you wrote your task in. Starting a task returns a request id that you can use to get the status or result of your task. The result of the task is the what your task function returned.

Here is sample code that shows how to instantiate a client and run a task.

<Tabs groupId="lang">
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
from cakework import Client
import time

if __name__ == "__main__":

    # Instantiate a client with the app you created, and pass in your client token.
    client = Client("yummy-new-app", "CLIENT_TOKEN")

    # Start your task. You use the same function signature that you wrote in your App.
    request_id = client.say_hello("Jessie")

    # Poll the task until completion.
    status = client.get_status(request_id)
    while (status == "PENDING" or status == "IN_PROGRESS"):
        time.sleep(1)
        print(status)
        status = client.get_status(request_id)

    # Get the result once the task is complete!
    if (client.get_status(request_id) == "SUCCEEDED"):
        result = client.get_result(request_id)
        print(result)
```

### Installing Dependencies
You can install dependencies with pip3, just include it in your ```requirements.txt```. 

### Error Handling
Any exceptions or errors in your task function will send your task to a ```FAILED``` status.

### Debugging

Coming soon!

### Local Development
