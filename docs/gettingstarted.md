# Getting Started

Hi friend! Cakework is a set of simple APIs for building serverless directly into your developer product. You describe how you want to package and run your users' code, and use Cakework to build images from Github, CLI, or even a browser. You use our APIs to run that code securely, and show logs and metrics back to your users.

Reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/yB6GvheDcP) or [email](mailto:eric@cakework.com) to get access and get started!
