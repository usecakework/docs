# Getting Started

Hi friend! Cakework helps you run your users' code with just a few APIs. This can be anything from a snippet of Python to a full-on cloud offering for a web framework. We do this under the covers by spinning up VMs (and groups of load balanced VMs) very fast.

Reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/yB6GvheDcP) or [email](mailto:eric@cakework.com) to get access and get started!
